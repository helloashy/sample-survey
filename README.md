# sample-survey
This repository is created to discuss and to get the knowledge regarding how to do effective sample survey and based on that survey which line of code will be best to get the most out of that raw data through python or RStudio.
Hi, I am a college student in my 2nd year with major in statistics and minor in economics and i want to do a sample survey on my college campus where i will collect the sample by stratified random sampling, here i think i am still lacking in collecting the data as it somehow is not that effective so what i want to know which method is best for collecting a sample from studing which i can make an effective and better understanding of the population. Also what this sample survey is about and what actually the project is i am writing down below here:
1.) I am collecting the data from the students of mine college since the total population of students is about 2300, and the topic is about how you completiing the task of fake reviews of products/services/apps you use/website you have visited is affecting others who wants to use the same and after writing fake reviews on same how much you are able to trust those reviews on any other platforms for the same, and whatever the fake reviews they are writing for who have asked them to do so a freind, or you are doing for the money, or the colleges socities or club had assigned you to do this so they can collect funds for their activities or events.
